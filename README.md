# Random small AAP things

This will be a place to gather all the little AAP things that I've found useful.

First cab off the rank is [rh-ah-token-refresh](rh-ah-token-refresh), which is designed to allow you to automate the renewal of your Red Hat Automation Hub token at sso.redhat.com.

When I have the time to bring them in here, I'll add some things to export the AAP configuration in two forms: a single yaml file, and a filetree (easier for humans to parse but occasionally not quite correct). Others will come up over time.
